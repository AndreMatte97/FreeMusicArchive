Report for a project about a musical dataset, on which we test a variety of ML algorithms.

Table of contents:

1 - Data Understanding and Preparation (Feature selection, missing values handling, feature engineering, anomaly detection).

2 - Classification: Genre recognition task with Decision Trees and KNN, applying techniques for imbalanced learning.

3 - Advanced Classification: Genre recognition task with Naive Bayes Classifier, Logistic Regression, Rule-Based classifier, SVM, NN, Random Forest, plus a Regression task.

4 - Time Series Analysis: Data preparation on a temporal dataset, clustering using the proper approximation techniques, search for anomalies and motifs, and classification using a Shapelet-based method.

5 - Sequential Pattern Mining.

6 - Clustering with X-Means.

7 - Transactional Clustering.

8 - Explainability with LIME and SHAP.
